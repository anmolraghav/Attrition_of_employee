# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the attrition rate of employees within a company based on various factors such as gender, years of work, and other relevant attributes. Understanding these factors can help the company identify patterns and potentially reduce employee turnover by addressing the underlying issues.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to determine the attrition rate of employees and understand the influence of different factors on this rate. The factors considered in this analysis include:

- Gender
- Years of work
- Age
- Department
- Job role
- Education level
- Monthly income
- Job satisfaction

By analyzing these factors, we aim to provide insights into the key drivers of employee attrition and suggest strategies to improve employee retention.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains employee information, including their demographic details, job-related attributes, and whether they have left the company. The dataset is assumed to be available in a CSV file format with the following columns:

- `EmployeeID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Department`
- `JobRole`
- `Education`
- `MaritalStatus`
- `YearsAtCompany`
- `MonthlyIncome`
- `JobSatisfaction`

- `Attrition` (Yes/No)

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and preprocess the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data and identify any patterns or correlations.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most significant features that impact employee attrition.
4. **Modeling**: Use various machine learning models to predict employee attrition based on the selected features.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and choose the best-performing model.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derive insights from the analysis and suggest recommendations to reduce employee attrition.
